## AI Analysis & Data Integration

### ðŸ”´ PI1.1: AI Analysis Scope

**Question**: What specific competition characteristics should the AI analyze for personalized recommendations?

**Context**: The AI needs to understand competition types to provide better phase recommendations.

**Sub-questions**:

- What competition characteristics should be analyzed? (distance, terrain, elevation, weather, etc.)
- Should the AI consider user's historical performance data from connected platforms?
- How should the AI handle new competition types it hasn't seen before?
- What data sources should the AI use for competition analysis?

**Impact**: This affects the accuracy and personalization of AI recommendations.

### ðŸ”´ PI1.3: Data Types & Privacy

**Question**: What data types should we pull from connected platforms and how should we handle privacy?

**Context**: We need to balance data utility with user privacy and consent.

**Sub-questions**:

- What specific data types should we import? (workout history, performance metrics, recovery data, etc.)
- How should we handle user consent and data sharing preferences?
- What data retention policies should we implement?
- How should we handle data deletion requests?

**Impact**: This affects user trust and legal compliance.

## Integration Architecture

### ðŸ”´ PI2.1: Data Synchronization Strategy

**Question**: How should we handle real-time vs. batch data synchronization?

**Context**: Different platforms have different synchronization capabilities and requirements.

**Sub-questions**:

- Should we use real-time sync or batch processing?
- How often should we sync data from each platform?
- How should we handle sync failures and retry logic?
- Should users be able to control sync frequency?

**Impact**: This affects data freshness and system performance.

### ðŸ”´ PI2.2: Data Normalization

**Question**: How should we normalize data from different platforms?

**Context**: Different platforms use different data formats and units.

**Sub-questions**:

- How should we standardize workout types across platforms?
- How should we handle different units (miles vs km, etc.)?
- How should we merge data from multiple platforms for the same user?
- How should we handle conflicting or duplicate data?

**Impact**: This affects data quality and user experience.
