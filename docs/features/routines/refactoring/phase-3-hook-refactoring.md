## ðŸ”„ PR #17 (Enhanced): Simplify useWorkoutOperations

**Status:** PENDING  
**Files:** `features/routines/hooks/workout/shared/useWorkoutOperations.ts`

### The Problem

Even after breaking it down, useWorkoutOperations can become a "god hook" that knows too much.

### The Solution

Create a "service hook" that encapsulates the actual operations, and then have smaller, more focused hooks that use it.

### Detailed Breakdown

#### useWorkoutService.ts (New Hook): This hook is responsible for the core, reusable logic of workout operations. It doesn't know about strength vs. running.

```typescript
// hooks/useWorkoutService.ts
export const useWorkoutService = (workouts, setWorkouts) => {
  const addWorkout = newWorkout => {
    /* ... */
  };
  const removeWorkout = workoutId => {
    /* ... */
  };
  const updateWorkout = (workoutId, updates) => {
    /* ... */
  };

  return { addWorkout, removeWorkout, updateWorkout };
};
```

#### useStrengthWorkoutOperations.ts (Refactored): This hook now becomes a thin wrapper around useWorkoutService, adding the strength-specific logic.

```typescript
// hooks/useStrengthWorkoutOperations.ts
export const useStrengthWorkoutOperations = (workouts, setWorkouts) => {
  const workoutService = useWorkoutService(workouts, setWorkouts);

  const addStrengthWorkout = () => {
    const newWorkout = { type: 'strength' /* ... */ };
    workoutService.addWorkout(newWorkout);
  };

  const updateProgressionMethod = (workoutId, method) => {
    // Strength-specific logic
    workoutService.updateWorkout(workoutId, { progressionMethod: method });
  };

  return { ...workoutService, addStrengthWorkout, updateProgressionMethod };
};
```

### Benefits

- **Reduces Code Duplication**: The core logic (addWorkout, removeWorkout) is in one place
- **Improves Maintainability**: If you need to change how a workout is added, you only change it in useWorkoutService
- **Clearer Abstractions**: Each hook has a very clear and defined responsibility

**Target:** < 200 lines (from 625 lines)

**Status:** PENDING  
**Files:** `features/routines/hooks/`

### Changes

- Create sub-folder structure for better organization
- Separate state management from operations
- Group by domain (strength/running/shared)
- Improve maintainability and discoverability

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Create State Management Folder** (4 files):
   - Move `useRoutineCreationState.ts` to `hooks/state/`
   - Move `useSetManagementState.ts` to `hooks/state/`
   - Move `useStrengthWorkoutState.ts` to `hooks/state/`
   - Move `useRunningWorkoutState.ts` to `hooks/state/`
   - Add `hooks/state/index.ts` for re-exports

2. **Create Operations Folder Structure** (9 files):
   - **Strength Operations** (`hooks/operations/strength/`):
     - Move `useStrengthWorkoutOperations.ts`
     - Move `useStrengthSectionOperations.ts`
     - Move `useStrengthExerciseOperations.ts`
   - **Running Operations** (`hooks/operations/running/`):
     - Move `useRunningWorkoutOperations.ts`
     - Move `useRunningSectionOperations.ts`
     - Move `useRunningExerciseOperations.ts`
   - **Shared Operations** (`hooks/operations/shared/`):
     - Move `useWorkoutOperations.ts`
     - Move `useExerciseOperations.ts`
     - Move `useRoutineOperations.ts`

3. **Create Specialized Folder** (1 file):
   - Move `useTrailRunningWorkout.ts` to `hooks/specialized/`
   - Add `hooks/specialized/index.ts` for re-exports

4. **Update Main Index** (1 file):
   - Create `hooks/index.ts` with re-exports from all sub-folders
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Organize exports by category

5. **Update Import Paths**:
   - Update all imports throughout the codebase
   - Ensure tests continue to work
   - Update any barrel exports

### Benefits

- **Clear separation of concerns** (state vs operations)
- **Logical grouping by domain** (strength/running/shared)
- **Easier to find related hooks**
- **Better maintainability and scalability**
- **Reduced cognitive load when navigating**
- **Follows established patterns in the codebase**
- **Makes the codebase more professional**
- **Improves developer experience**
- **Easier to add new hooks in the future**
- **Better test organization**

### Migration Strategy

1. Create new folder structure
2. Move files one by one
3. Update imports incrementally
4. Maintain backward compatibility with re-exports
5. Update tests to use new paths
6. Remove old files after verification

**Target:** Clean hooks structure with logical grouping
