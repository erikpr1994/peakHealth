# Phase 1: Foundational Reorganization (The "Big Shuffle")

## Overview

Before we start breaking down large files, let's get the folder structure right. This will make all subsequent steps much cleaner.

## ðŸ”„ PR #A: Restructure the routines feature folder

**Status:** PENDING  
**Branch:** `refactor/routines-folder-restructure`

### Changes

Instead of a flat structure, we'll adopt a more domain-driven and feature-based hierarchy.

### Proposed routines Folder Structure

```
features/routines/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                # API client layer for routines
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Icons, images, etc.

### Justification

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: This structure clearly separates concerns at a high level
- **Improved Discoverability**: Need to change an API call? Go to `api/`. Need to fix a UI bug in routine creation? Go to `features/routine-creation/`
- **Scalability**: As the feature grows, we can add new sub-features to the `features` directory without cluttering the root
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Each folder has a clear, single responsibility

### Migration Strategy

1. **Create new folder structure**
2. **Move files incrementally** to avoid breaking changes
3. **Update imports** systematically
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** with re-exports
5. **Update tests** to use new paths
6. **Remove old files** after verification

### Benefits

- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between shared and feature-specific code
- **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find what they're looking for
- **Reduced Coupling**: Features are more isolated from each other
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes are more localized
- **Better Testing**: Easier to test features in isolation
