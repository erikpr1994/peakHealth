## üìÅ New Document Structure

The refactoring plan has been split into focused documents in the `docs/features/routines/refactoring/` folder:

- **[README.md](./refactoring/README.md)** - Main overview and strategy
- **[Phase 1: Foundational Reorganization](./refactoring/phase-1-foundational-reorganization.md)** - Folder structure and type extraction
- **[Phase 2: Component Decomposition](./refactoring/phase-2-component-decomposition.md)** - Breaking down large components
- **[Phase 3: Hook Refactoring](./refactoring/phase-3-hook-refactoring.md)** - Advanced hook patterns and organization
- **[Phase 4: Domain & Services](./refactoring/phase-4-domain-services.md)** - Business logic and service layer separation
- **[Phase 5: Feature-Specific Refactoring](./refactoring/phase-5-feature-specific.md)** - Feature-specific improvements
- **[Progress Tracking](./refactoring/progress-tracking.md)** - Current status and next steps
- **[Implementation Guidelines](./refactoring/implementation-guidelines.md)** - How to implement the refactoring safely
