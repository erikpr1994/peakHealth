# Routines Feature - Feature Overview

## Overview

The Routines feature is a comprehensive workout management system that allows users to create, manage, and track various types of workout routines. It supports both strength training and cardio/running workouts with advanced features like trail running planning. This document outlines the designed features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture ‚úÖ **DESIGNED**

**Decision**: **The architecture is based on a decoupled frontend and backend, with a clearly defined data model and API contract.** The backend uses MongoDB on Railway, with Supabase for authentication. The frontend is built with Next.js and follows a domain-driven structure with a dedicated services layer.

### Feature Structure (Frontend)

The frontend follows a domain-driven structure for clear separation of concerns, as defined in the technical specification.

```
features/routines/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                # API client layer for routines (e.g., SWR hooks)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/         # SHARED components used across the routines feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/           # Feature-scoped context providers (e.g., RoutineBuilder)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/             # Core, pure business logic (no UI, no API calls)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/              # Page-level components that orchestrate features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # Higher-level services that orchestrate domain logic and API calls
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # SHARED type definitions for the feature
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts            # Public API of the routines feature
```

### Core Pages (User App)

- **Routines Dashboard** (`/routines`): The main landing page, showing the user's active routine, their other routines, and recommended templates.
- **Routine Detail** (`/routines/:id`): A detailed, tabbed view of a single routine, including an overview, weekly schedule, and full workout breakdown.
- **Explore Templates** (`/routines/explore`): A gallery for browsing and filtering all available public routine templates.
- **Create/Edit Routine** (`/routines/new`, `/routines/:id/edit`): The main routine builder interface for creating and modifying user-owned routines.
- **Workout Player** (`/workout/:sessionId`): The in-workout experience for performing and logging a scheduled workout session.

## üìä Data Models ‚úÖ **DESIGNED**

The data model is built on MongoDB and separates **The Plan** (the structure of routines) from **The Action** (the execution of workouts).

### Core Concepts

- **Template vs. User-Created**: Routines are either versioned, read-only `TemplateRoutine`s (from trainers/company) or mutable `UserCreatedRoutine`s.
- **Versioning & Immutability**: Templates are versioned to allow updates without affecting assigned users. A user is always assigned to a specific, immutable version.
- **Snapshots for History**: When a workout is scheduled, an immutable `workoutSnapshot` is created in the `WorkoutSession`. This guarantees the user's historical record is never altered by future changes to a template.

### MongoDB Collections

- **`sections`**: Reusable, version-controlled section templates.
- **`workouts`**: Reusable, version-controlled workout templates.
- **`routines`**: Stores all `TemplateRoutine` and `UserCreatedRoutine` documents.
- **`routine_assignments`**: Links a user to a specific version of a `TemplateRoutine`.
- **`workout_sessions`**: Contains every scheduled workout, including the immutable `workoutSnapshot` and the user's `performanceLog`.

_Note: The master Exercise Library and User data are managed in Supabase._

## üîß Hooks & State Management ‚úÖ **DESIGNED**

The frontend employs a sophisticated state management strategy to handle the complexity of the feature while keeping components clean.

### **Page-Level Hooks**

For standard pages (Dashboard, Detail, Explore), a single page-level hook (e.g., `useRoutinesDashboard`) acts as the source of truth, fetching data via SWR and managing UI state.

### **Routine Builder Context**

For the deeply nested Routine Builder UI, a dedicated, feature-scoped React Context (`RoutineBuilderContext`) is used to avoid prop drilling.

- **`useRoutineBuilder`**: A `useReducer`-based hook that manages the entire state of the routine being built. It is called once at the page level.
- **`RoutineBuilderProvider`**: Wraps the builder UI, making the state and dispatch function available to all children.
- **Selector Hooks** (e.g., `useSection`, `useExercise`): Small, memoized hooks that consume the context and select a specific slice of state for a component. This keeps components simple and performant.

## üéØ MVP Scope

This section outlines the scope of the features that have been designed for the MVP. The design phase is complete, and this represents the blueprint for implementation.

#### **Backend & Database**

- **Database Schema**: A complete MongoDB schema has been designed for all 5 core collections (`sections`, `workouts`, `routines`, `routine_assignments`, `workout_sessions`).
- **API Endpoints**: A full API contract has been defined for all CRUD operations, including library versioning and user-facing endpoints.
- **Authentication**: The authentication strategy will use Supabase JWTs with the Railway backend.
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive TypeScript data models have been defined for all core concepts.

#### **Frontend**

- **Architecture**: A robust frontend architecture has been specified, including a domain-driven folder structure, a services layer, and advanced hook patterns.
- **Page Structure**: All primary user-facing pages and their component breakdowns have been fully defined.
- **State Management**: A clear strategy has been defined for both simple pages (using page-level hooks) and complex UIs (using a feature-scoped context).
- **Component Design**: A library of shared, granular components has been designed to build the UI.
- **UI Logic**: Core frontend logic for features like Trail Running, progression methods, and workout calculations has been documented.

## üöß **Remaining Work**

The design phase is complete. The primary remaining work is the implementation of the frontend and backend based on these designs.

### **High Priority (MVP Implementation)**

#### **1. Backend Implementation**
