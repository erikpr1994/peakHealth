# Routines Feature - MVP Scope

## Overview

This document defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope for the Routines feature, outlining the essential functionality required for initial release.

## 🎯 **MVP Goals** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Decision**: **Comprehensive MVP with tiered feature access and progressive enhancement**

### **Primary Objectives**

1. **Core Functionality**: Enable users to create, edit, and manage basic workout routines
2. **Data Persistence**: Store and retrieve routine data with proper user association and version history
3. **Tiered Integration**: Connect with user authentication and exercise library (referenced with local storage)
4. **User Experience**: Provide intuitive interface with progressive disclosure and tiered feature access
5. **Workout Integration**: Hybrid approach for workout tracker integration

### **Success Criteria**

- Users can create and edit routines successfully with version history
- Routine data persists across sessions with proper user association
- Integration with user authentication works seamlessly (role-based access)
- Exercise library integration is functional (referenced with local storage sync)
- UI is responsive and user-friendly with progressive disclosure
- Workout tracker integration provides both automatic and manual options
