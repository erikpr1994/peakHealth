# 3. Progression Methods

Progression methods are strategies for systematically increasing the difficulty of a workout over time to drive continuous improvement (a principle known as progressive overload).

- **Linear Progression**: The most straightforward method. The user increases the weight or reps in a linear fashion from one workout to the next (e.g., add 5 lbs to squats every session).
- **Dual Progression**: A method where the user first increases the number of repetitions with a given weight. Once they can complete a target number of reps for all sets, they increase the weight and drop the reps back down, repeating the cycle.
- **Inverse Pyramid**: The user starts with a lighter weight for high reps and gradually increases the weight while decreasing the reps with each set.
- **Myo-Reps**: An advanced technique involving an initial "activation set" close to failure, followed by several short "mini-sets" with minimal rest. This is designed to maximize muscle fiber recruitment.
- **Widowmaker**: Typically involves performing a single, high-rep set (often 20 reps) of a challenging compound exercise like squats. It's a high-intensity technique for building muscle and mental toughness.
- **AMRAP (As Many Reps/Rounds As Possible)**: The goal is to perform as many repetitions or rounds of an exercise or circuit as possible within a specified timeframe.

## Advanced & Autoregulatory Methods

- **Percentage-Based Progression**: Training load is prescribed as a percentage of a user's one-rep max (1RM). Progression involves increasing the percentages or the 1RM over time.
- **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)**: An autoregulatory method where the intensity of a set is guided by how hard it feels on a scale (e.g., 1-10). Progression is achieved by increasing weight while maintaining the same RPE.
- **Time Under Tension (TUT)**: Focuses on the total time a muscle is under strain during a set, often controlled by a specific tempo (e.g., a slow 4-second negative).
- **Wave Loading**: Involves performing "waves" of sets. In each wave, the weight increases and the reps decrease. Subsequent waves start at a slightly heavier weight than the previous one.
- **Cluster Sets**: A traditional set is broken down into smaller "clusters" of reps with very short, intra-set rest periods (e.g., 10-30 seconds), allowing for more total reps to be performed with a heavier weight.
- **Rest-Pause**: A technique where a set is performed to near-failure, followed by a very brief rest, after which more reps are performed with the same weight. This is repeated for several "mini-sets."
