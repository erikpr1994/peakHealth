# 3. Progression Methods

Progression methods are strategies for systematically increasing the difficulty of a workout over time to drive continuous improvement (a principle known as progressive overload).

- **Linear Progression**: The most straightforward method. The user increases the weight or reps in a linear fashion from one workout to the next (e.g., add 5 lbs to squats every session).
- **Dual Progression**: A method where the user first increases the number of repetitions with a given weight. Once they can complete a target number of reps for all sets, they increase the weight and drop the reps back down, repeating the cycle.
- **Inverse Pyramid**: The user starts with a lighter weight for high reps and gradually increases the weight while decreasing the reps with each set.
- **Myo-Reps**: An advanced technique involving an initial "activation set" close to failure, followed by several short "mini-sets" with minimal rest. This is designed to maximize muscle fiber recruitment.
- **Widowmaker**: Typically involves performing a single, high-rep set (often 20 reps) of a challenging compound exercise like squats. It's a high-intensity technique for building muscle and mental toughness.
- **AMRAP (As Many Reps/Rounds As Possible)**: The goal is to perform as many repetitions or rounds of an exercise or circuit as possible within a specified timeframe.
