# 2. Section Types

Sections provide structure to a workout. Different types of sections are used to achieve specific training goals.

## Common Sections
- **Warmup**: Prepares the body for exercise by gradually increasing heart rate and blood flow to the muscles.
- **Cooldown**: Helps the body transition from exercise back to a resting state, often involving stretching.

## Strength Sections
- **Basic**: A standard section for strength training, consisting of a list of exercises performed for a specified number of sets and reps.
- **EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)**: A workout style where you perform a specific exercise at the start of every minute for a set amount of time.
- **Tabata**: A form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with 20 seconds of ultra-intense exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated for a number of rounds.
- **Circuit**: A series of exercises performed in sequence with minimal rest in between. After completing all exercises in the circuit, the user takes a longer rest before starting the next round.

## Running Sections
- **Intervals**: Alternating between periods of high-intensity running and recovery periods.
- **Tempo**: A sustained run at a challenging but controlled pace, designed to improve lactate threshold.
- **Fartlek**: An unstructured form of speed work where the runner varies the intensity and duration of their pace based on how they feel.
- **Hill Repeats**: Repeatedly running up and down a hill to build strength and stamina.
