# Routines Feature - Planning Questions

This document contains all the questions we need to answer to properly plan and implement the remaining work for the Routines feature.

## üèóÔ∏è **Data Architecture Questions**

### **Q1.1: Database Schema Design** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Question**: How should routines be structured in the database? Should we use a normalized approach or JSON storage for complex workout data?

**Context**: The current routines feature has complex nested data structures (routines ‚Üí workouts ‚Üí sections ‚Üí exercises ‚Üí sets). We need to decide on the optimal database schema.

**Options**:

- **Option A**: Fully normalized tables (routines, workouts, sections, exercises, sets) ‚úÖ **SELECTED**
- **Option B**: Hybrid approach (routines table + JSON columns for complex data)
- **Option C**: Document-based approach (JSON storage for entire routines)

**Decision**: **Option A - Fully normalized tables**

**Rationale**:

- Better data integrity and consistency
- Superior query performance for complex operations
- Easier to scale and optimize individual tables
- More flexible for future features and integrations
- Better support for analytics and reporting
- Easier to implement routine sharing and versioning

**Implementation**: Will use normalized tables: routines, workouts, workout_sections, exercises, exercise_sets, trail_running_data, trail_running_intervals

**Considerations**:

- Query performance for different use cases
- Data consistency and integrity
- Flexibility for future changes
- Migration complexity
