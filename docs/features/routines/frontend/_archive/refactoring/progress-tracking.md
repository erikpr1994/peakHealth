# Progress Tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Approach

**Important**: This refactoring involves creating **completely new code** that replicates existing functionality, not modifying existing files directly.

### Process for Each PR:

1. **Study existing code** to understand patterns and business logic
2. **Create new files** with better structure and organization
3. **Copy and adapt** business logic from existing files
4. **Test new components** against existing functionality
5. **Gradually replace** old components with new ones

## Summary

- **Total PRs:** 38
- **Completed:** 0 (0%)
- **Pending:** 38 (100%)

## Next Steps

1. **Start with PR #A** - Restructure the routines feature folder to establish the proper foundation
2. **Continue with component decomposition** - Focus on the largest components first
3. **Move to hook refactoring** - Simplify complex hooks using service patterns
4. **Clean up domain and services** - Establish clear separation of concerns
5. **Finish with feature-specific improvements** - Polish and optimize each feature

## Priority Order

### Phase 1: Foundation First (Start Here)

**Start with the smallest, most foundational pieces:**

1. **PR #1: Extract Routine Types** - Small, pure type definitions
2. **PR #2: Extract Workout Types** - Small, pure type definitions
3. **PR #3: Extract Exercise Types** - Small, pure type definitions
4. **PR #4: Extract Trail Running Types** - Small, pure type definitions
5. **PR #5: Extract Workout Calculations** - Pure business logic functions
6. **PR #6: Extract Data Transformers** - Pure transformation functions
7. **PR #7: Extract Strength Workout Operations** - Small, focused hooks
8. **PR #8: Extract Running Workout Operations** - Small, focused hooks
9. **PR #9: Extract Exercise Operations** - Small, focused hooks
10. **PR #10: Extract RoutineCreation State** - State management logic
11. **PR #11: Extract SetManagement State** - State management logic
12. **PR #26: Split Utils by Responsibility** - Small utility functions
13. **PR #25: Resolve Type Circular Dependencies** - Clean up type organization

### Phase 2: Medium Components

**Move to medium-sized components and services:**

14. **PR #A: Restructure the routines feature folder** - Organize the foundation
15. **PR #27: Organize Hooks with Sub-folders** - Better hook organization
16. **PR #24: Split RoutineService** - Service layer decomposition
17. **PR #17: Simplify useWorkoutOperations** - Hook decomposition
18. **PR #18: Simplify useRoutineOperations** - Hook decomposition
19. **PR #19: Extract RoutineCreation Handlers** - Event handler extraction
20. **PR #20: Extract SetManagement Handlers** - Event handler extraction

### Phase 3: Large Components

**Finally tackle the largest, most complex components:**

21. **PR #14: Break Down DynamicWeightInput Component** - Large component
22. **PR #13: Break Down SetManagement Component** - Large component
23. **PR #28: Break Down RoutineCreation Component** - Very large component
24. **PR #29: Break Down Large Section Components** - Large section components
25. **PR #30: Break Down RoutineDetail Component** - Large component
26. **PR #32: Break Down RoutineList Components** - Large components
27. **PR #34: Break Down WorkoutManagement Components** - Large components
28. **PR #36: Break Down TrailRunning Components** - Large components

### Phase 4: Polish and Organization

**Final cleanup and organization:**

29. **PR #12: Move SetManagement to Feature Location** - File organization
30. **PR #21: Simplify RoutineCreation Container** - Container simplification
31. **PR #22: Split Large Test Files** - Test organization
32. **PR #23: Simplify Main Index Exports** - Export organization
33. **PR #31: Improve Component Organization** - Component organization
34. **PR #33: Improve Component Organization** - Component organization
35. **PR #35: Improve Component Organization** - Component organization
36. **PR #37: Break Down TrailRunning Components** - Large components
37. **PR #38: Prepare for Running Type Expansion** - Future preparation

## Implementation Strategy

### Bottom-Up Approach

1. **Start Small**: Begin with types, utils, and pure functions
2. **Build Up**: Move to hooks, state management, and business logic
3. **Decompose Components**: Break down large components into smaller pieces
4. **Organize**: Clean up file structure and exports
5. **Polish**: Final improvements and future-proofing

### Benefits of This Order

- **Easier Testing**: Small, pure functions are easier to test
- **Fewer Dependencies**: Foundation pieces have fewer dependencies
- **Incremental Progress**: Each small PR builds on the previous ones
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller changes are less likely to break things
- **Better Understanding**: Working with small pieces helps understand the codebase
