# Frontend Documentation

This directory contains all documentation related to the frontend implementation of the Routines feature, broken down by application.

Our initial focus is the **User App**.

## User App

-   [Page Structure](./user-app-pages.md): A breakdown of the primary pages and their purpose.
-   `/components`: Detailed breakdown of the component architecture, props, and state management.
-   `/state-management`: Strategy for managing frontend state (e.g., SWR for server state, Zustand/Context for UI state).
-   `/user-flows`: Descriptions and diagrams of key user interactions.
-   `/testing`: Strategy for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
