## Phase Calculation Logic

### 游릭 Q1.1: Automatic Phase Duration Calculation

**Question**: Should the system automatically calculate phase durations based on competition date?

**Context**: For trail runners, if they set a competition date 6 months away, should the system automatically suggest:

- Base Building: 2 months
- Build Phase: 2 months
- Peak Phase: 2 months

**Sub-questions**:

- What's the minimum/maximum recommended training time for different competition types?
- Should there be different phase structures for different race distances?
- How should the system handle very short (1-2 months) or very long (12+ months) preparation periods?

**Impact**: This affects the core user experience and automation level of the system.

**Answer**: YES, with intelligent recommendations and user control:

**System Approach**:

- **Automatic calculation** of phase durations based on start date and competition date
- **Recommendations only** - users have final decision and can override
- **AI-powered analysis** using competition type and characteristics
- **Integration with health/performance stats** from platforms like Strava, Garmin Connect

**Competition Validation**:

- **Alert system** for competitions too close to current date
- **Recommend alternative objectives** when timeline is insufficient
- **Competition-specific analysis** based on type and characteristics

**User Control**:

- **Accept/reject recommendations** - users must explicitly accept the proposed structure
- **Override capability** - users can modify phase durations and structures
- **Flexible timelines** for Health/Weight Loss users

**Implementation**:

- AI-powered competition analysis and timeline recommendations
- Integration with fitness platforms for personalized recommendations (future iteration)
- Phase-by-phase review workflow with overall plan overview
- Smart defaults approach (similar to routine smartDefaults.ts)
- Adaptive planning based on phase outcomes
- Alternative suggestions when timeline is insufficient

**Future Considerations**:

- Platform integrations will be handled in separate integration feature
- Trial periods for trainer-managed users (routine feature consideration)
- Competition change handling (open question for future)
