# Files

<!-- markdownlint-configure-file {"MD029": {"style": "ordered"}} -->

1. Keep files small
   - Non-test, non-config, non-rules files should be under 300 lines.
   - 200–300 lines is a refactor signal: extract components, hooks, utils, or types.
   - When refactoring, start with the smallest and deepest units of code first (e.g., extract `Input` and `Button` before `reusableComponent`, then work up to larger components).

2. Split by responsibility
   - UI into smaller components (co-locate in `components/`).
   - State logic into `hooks/` or `context/`.
   - Domain pure logic under `features/<feature>/domain/` (or `mappers/`, `formatters/`, `validators/`, `calculations/`). Reserve `utils/` only for generic, cross-cutting helpers. Shared shapes go in `types/`.

3. Place by feature
   - Co-locate everything under `features/<feature_name>/...` (components, hooks, context, tests, types).

4. Naming and file types
   - React components: `PascalCase.tsx` (one primary component per file).
   - Hooks/utils: `camelCase.ts`.
   - Styles: `ComponentName.module.css` next to the component.
   - Avoid generic catch-all files like `helpers.ts` or `utils.ts`; use intent-revealing names (e.g., `computeWorkoutVolume.ts`).
   - Types: keep files small; split into multiple files inside `types/` by domain/entity (e.g., `routine.ts`, `exercise.ts`); use named exports; avoid a catch-all `types.ts`.

5. Styles
   - Use CSS Modules only; no utility CSS frameworks.
   - In `packages/ui`, only `design-system.css` is exported; do not export other CSS from `dist`.

6. Exports
   - Prefer named exports for shared modules; avoid large default-export barrels.
   - Keep `index.ts` barrels minimal and stable (feature-level public API only).

7. Imports
   - Prefer path aliases (e.g., `@/`) over deep relative chains.
   - Do not import from another feature’s internals; depend on its public barrel if needed.

8. Tests
   - Co-locate as `*.test.ts(x)` next to the file.
   - Keep tests focused; split oversized specs rather than exceeding several hundred lines.

9. Route files and pages
   - Keep route/page files thin; move logic/UI into feature components and hooks.

10. Housekeeping

- Remove dead files promptly.
- Avoid committing generated or `dist` artifacts (except designated exports).

11. UI components and design system

- Make UI components as generic as possible. If a component has reuse potential (e.g., buttons, labels, inputs, modals, toasts), create it in the `@ui/` package.
- Keep app-level components feature-specific. When a pattern becomes generic, promote it to `@ui/`.
- Components in `@ui/` should import their own CSS internally; only `design-system.css` is exported from the package.
