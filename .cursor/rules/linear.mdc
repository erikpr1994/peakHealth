Before creating a Linear ticket or a set of tickets, you must first fetch all the latest data from Linear. This includes teams, cycles, issue statuses, issue labels, projects, project labels, and users.

Once you have fetched all the data, you must update the `linear_documentation.md` file.

Only after this documentation file is up-to-date should you proceed with creating the ticket or tickets.

To create a new ticket, ask for the following information. All the necessary information for these fields can be found in the `linear_documentation.md` file:

- **Title**: A clear and concise title for the issue.
- **Team**: The team responsible for the issue (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Product).
- **Description**: A detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce for bugs, or requirements for features.
- **Assignee**: The person responsible for the ticket.
- **Cycle**: The cycle to which the ticket should be assigned.
- **Labels**: Any relevant labels (e.g., Bug, Feature, Improvement).
- **Project**: The project this issue belongs to.

For a **sub-ticket**, you must also provide the **Parent ID** of the parent issue.

Once you have gathered all the necessary information, use the `create_issue` tool to create the ticket. Refer to `linear_documentation.md` for available IDs and names for teams, cycles, labels, projects, and users.
